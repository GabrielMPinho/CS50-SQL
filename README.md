# CS50 SQL Projects

This repository contains my work, notes, and solutions from **CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL**. The course introduces fundamental and advanced concepts in relational databases, using **SQLite** for portability and expanding to **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** for scalability.

## 📘 About the Course

CS50 SQL focuses on how to create, read, update, and delete data in relational databases. It also teaches how to properly design tables, model relationships, and manage large datasets inspired by real-world scenarios.

Throughout the course, I learned how to:

* Work with relational databases storing data in rows and columns.
* Model entities and relationships with appropriate types, triggers, and constraints.
* Normalize data to reduce redundancy and errors.
* Join tables using **primary** and **foreign keys**.
* Automate searches with **views**.
* Improve performance with **indexes**.
* Connect SQL with other languages, such as **Python** and **Java**.

## 🔑 Key Topics Covered

* **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
* **Database Design**: Tables, schemas, triggers, and constraints.
* **Normalization**: Eliminating redundancy and improving consistency.
* **Joins**: Combining tables with primary and foreign keys.
* **Views & Indexes**: Automating and optimizing queries.
* **Integration**: Using SQL with Python and Java.
* **Scalability**: Moving from SQLite to PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## ⚡ Technologies

* **SQLite** → lightweight, portable database engine.
* **PostgreSQL** → powerful, open-source relational database.
* **MySQL** → widely used database system for scalable applications.
* **Python & Java** → for integration with databases.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is both a **portfolio** and a **learning journal**.
It demonstrates my progress through CS50 SQL while providing examples of database concepts applied to practical, real-world inspired problems.

Anyone interested in learning SQL basics and best practices can also use it as a reference.
