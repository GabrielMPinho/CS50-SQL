# CS50 SQL – Week 0

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions for **Week 0** of the **CS50 SQL** course.
In this first week, the course introduces the basics of SQL, focusing on writing queries to explore and manipulate data in a relational database.
The exercises are based on the TV show **Cyberchase**, using a dataset of its episodes.

Each problem requires writing a single SQL query in a `.sql` file, following the instructions provided.

## Key Features

* Practice with **basic SELECT queries**.
* Use of **WHERE conditions**, **ORDER BY**, and **BETWEEN**.
* Introduction to **counting rows**, **filtering results**, and **ordering outputs**.
* Development of problem-solving skills in SQL by applying conditions and logic to real-world data.

## Problem Descriptions

* **1.sql** → List the titles of all episodes in Cyberchase’s original season (Season 1).
* **2.sql** → List the season number and title of the first episode of every season.
* **3.sql** → Find the production code for the episode *“Hackerized!”*.
* **4.sql** → Find the titles of episodes that do not yet have a listed topic.
* **5.sql** → Find the title of the holiday episode that aired on **December 31st, 2004**.
* **6.sql** → List the titles of episodes from **Season 6 (2008)** that were released early in **2007**.
* **7.sql** → List the titles and topics of all episodes teaching **fractions**.
* **8.sql** → Count the number of episodes released in the last **6 years (2018–2023)**.
* **9.sql** → Count the number of episodes released in Cyberchase’s first **6 years (2002–2007)**.
* **10.sql** → List the ids, titles, and production codes of all episodes, ordered by production code (earliest to latest).
* **11.sql** → List the titles of episodes from **Season 5**, in **reverse alphabetical order**.
* **12.sql** → Count the number of **unique episode titles**.
